## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Index 1.x]() is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games
without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a
number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS,
Windows).

## Free, open source and community-driven

INDEX is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Indev's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.

Before being open sourced in June 2023, Index 1.x (Atlas One) had been developed by Saúl Alejandro and
INDEV Technologies ApS (That will still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house and entreprise engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.
